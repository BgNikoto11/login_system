# Login System
## Project Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a user login and registration system using PHP and MySQL alongside XAMPP. The system provides essential features for user authentication and validation, facilitating a simple yet functional user experience. The project focuses on the backend layer of the web application, which includes creating and connecting to a database and manipulating the data based on server-side logic.

## What I Learned During This Project

Creating this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of backend programming. Building on my previous experience with basic CRUD operations, I learned how to leverage these foundational skills to develop a more sophisticated application. Here are some of the skills and insights I gained:

* __User Input Validation:__ Implementing logic to validate user inputs was crucial. This involved checking for empty fields, ensuring passwords match during registration, and verifying credentials during login.
* __Error Handling:__ Proper error handling was implemented to manage different scenarios, such as existing usernames during registration or incorrect login credentials. Redirecting users and displaying relevant error messages improved the overall user experience.
* __Session Management:__ I understood the importance of session management in PHP for maintaining user state across different pages. 
* __Backend Logic:__ The project reinforced my skills in writing backend logic to handle form submissions securely and efficiently. This included using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
